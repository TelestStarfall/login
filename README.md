Retrieve login and password information

Hey it's Telest starfall.
Thanks for cooperate with a newbie developer.

In this extension, I want to retreive the ID and the password of the current user ("option.js").
Then, I want to set it in the window.alert ("overlay.js")

In summary : 
1/ Put the ID and the password in the <textbox> => option.xul
2/ Get the <textbox> informations => option.js
3/ Send the value to overlay.js
4/ Display the information in button.xul

Any help or suggestions would be pleased.

Telest Starfall.
